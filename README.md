# Mock detector interface

This is a simple mock app to emulate the behaviour of a hardware detector when interfacing with the android sikorka app


# Installation

We need a Bluetooth enabled linux system with python 3.

Make sure bluetooth is activated and running -- guide may vary depending on your system -- for Arch check [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth).

```
systemctl start bluetooth.service
```
